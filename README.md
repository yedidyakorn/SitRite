# SitRite





SitRite -computer vision system that helps you to sit correctly during a workday. @Hackathon Great Minds 2020


Project descriptionAs part of Hackathon Great Minds 2020 we developed a computer vision system that helps every worker to sit correctly during a work day.
The system uses a camera located on the side of the worker, and analyzes his sitting. Once the system recognized a problematic sitting it notices the worker.

The project has reached the Hackathon final stage.
